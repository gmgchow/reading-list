## Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy The Odds (by David Goggins, 2018)
- Status: Done (Oct 2022)
- https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279
- Notes:
	- The author is definitely the "hardest man who ever lived"! He has been through a lot and reading about his story and how he defied all odds to become successful, made me realize how blessed I am. It made me want to try harder in life because if he can accomplish so much in his unfortunate circumstances, what can I do?
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because this is hands-down, the most inspirational book I've ever read. There are many quote-worthy lines in this book and it's made me really reflect on my life and what I want to do from now on.

## Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ (by Daniel Goleman, 2005)
- Status: Done (Sept 2022)
- https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X
- Notes:
	- I was surprised at the wide range of topics this book covers: the biology and development of emotions and EQ, how to communicate diplomatically and avoid fights at school, work, and even in marriage, healing from trauma, bullying, depression, raising children to have high EQ, and more!
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because every person should learn how to manage their emotions. It will make all aspects of your life go more smoothly, and the world would be a better place if everyone had high EQ.

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (by Mark Manson, 2016)
- Status: Done (Sept 2022)
- https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Mark-Manson/dp/0062457713
- Notes:
	- I found the writing style of this book to be too casual but the content is good. Basically it teaches a mindset of not caring for things that you cannot change so that you can live a more positive life.
	- Personal Rating: **9/10 (extremely helpful!)** because it's a common problem to care too much and overthink things in life. This book teaches you a healthier mindset so that you can become more resilient when life throws lemons at you.

## The Social Animal
- Status: Done (June 2021)
- https://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Elliot-Aronson-ebook/dp/B07CSJ3W4Q
- Notes:
	- It's a university-level psychology textbook so it's very long, but definitely worth reading!
	- It teaches principles of social psychology that you can use in persuading people, avoiding conflict, and making overall communication smoother
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because personally, I believe that everyone should know at least some social psychology. It can be used in daily life as well as work, regardless of the industry because human connection matters more than you think.

## How to Win Friends and Influence People (by Dale Carnegie, 1998)
- Status: Done (Sept 2021)
- https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034
- Notes:
	- It provides tips on how to be a likeable person, leave a good impression, and influence others to help you
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because even though some of the points seem like common sense (e.g. to be a great conversationist, talk about topics that the person likes, listen more than you speak, etc.), many people don't actually have this sense. By following these tips, I do think that people will like you more as a person, therefore making it more likely that they will listen to and come to your aid.

## The Third Ear: You Can Learn Any Language (by Chris Lonsdale, 2006)
- Status: Done (Feb 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00823W5B4
- Notes:
	- It provides lots of tips on how to become fluent in languages you're studying (the author himself is fluent in 5 languages and is conversational level in several more)
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because it preaches that the most important part of learning a language is daring to use it. I also believe that you have to continuously practice a language in order to become fluent so I found the anecdotal stories to be inspiriational.

## The Manager's Path (by Camille Fournier, 2017)
- Status: Done (August 2022)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/
- Notes:
	- This was an interesting read because it includes descriptions of different leadership roles (Senior IC, Tech Lead, Engineering Manager, Director, Senior Director, C-level executive) and advice for each.
	- It also has overall tips on how to grow and plan your career, how to communicate effectively with your manager/sub-ordinates/people in different levels of the hierarchy from you, how to have effective 1on1s, etc. I think this kind of advice is useful even to people who do not plan on moving into management roles.
	- Personal Rating: **7/10 (good to read)** because the advice is useful no matter what role you work in, and it also taught me traits of good leaders. This advice will not only be useful if I myself move into management in the future, but it'll also help me distinguish good leaders from not-so-good ones (:

## Influence (by Robert Cialdini, 2009)
- Status: Done (April 2021)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/influence/9780061899874/
- Notes:
	- I consider this as an introduction level book because it covers basics from first-year university psychology courses like Foot-in-door, Door-in-face, etc. Most points I already knew but if you don't have a background in psychology, it could be good to read.
	- Personal Rating: **7/10 (good to read)** because it did cover some good points to know but the wordy writing style made it difficult to read and stay focused. I think it could have been good if the writing was more concise and focused on teaching rather than going off into long detailed stories.
