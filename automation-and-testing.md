# Automation and Testing

## How Google Tests Software (by James A. Whittaker, Jason Arbon, Jeff Carollo)
- Status: DONE (July-Sept 2020)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/how-google-tests/9780132851572/
- Notes:
	- Discusses the differences between manual QA testers, SET (Software Engineer in Test), and QA Managers at Google
	- Discusses the possible future of testing and career growth for manual testers
	- Personal Rating: 8/10 (very good!) because it was interesting to see what the testing situation is like at Google, as the future of manual testing and QA are a heavily-debated topic now

## Experiences of Test Automation (by Mark Fewster, Dorothy Graham)
- Status: DONE (Jan-Mar 2020)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/experiences-of-test/9780132776608/
- Notes:
	- Each chapter is a case study on how automation failed or succeeded in a company
	- The book is easy to read- lessons that were learned, automation best practices, important points, etc. are highlighted in big boxes so that you know what to pay attention to
	- Personal Rating: 10/10 (must read!) because reading about how other companies succeeded or failed in automation can help us not make the same mistakes!

## Practical Security Automation and Testing (by Tony Hsiang-Chih Hsu)
- Status: DONE (Jan-Mar 2020)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-security-automation/9781789802023/
- Notes:
Extremely relevant; it talks about secure pipelines, SAST/DAST, DefectDojo, etc. 
- Introduces many tools for security testing and automation. Even if you don't use the same technology stack, it's still useful to know and interesting to read about (e.g. I did not know that JMeter could be used for security testing! I have only ever used it for load and QA testing)
- Personal Rating: 10/10 (must read!) because it is interesting to see how automation testing can be applied to security as well

	- Teaches how to write effective unit tests and how to think when testing code logic
	- API/integration level testing
	- Personal Rating: 7/10 (good to read) because it teaches how to write unit tests properly, which is an important skill for all engineers to have
