- Notes:
	- This is a really good book for beginners, it is straight-forward and explains what you should and should not do when investing
	- Covers most basics that any investor should know such as common sense, risk, portfolio allocation, distribution of assets, different types of investments, etc. 
	- Personal Rating: 10/10 (must read!) because it is easy to understand so I think it is a great first step for people who are completely new to investing
