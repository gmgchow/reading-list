# Microservices

## Go in Action (by William Kennedy with Brian Ketelsen and Erik St. Martin)
- Status: DONE (Jan-Mar 2020)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/go-in-action/9781617291784/
- Notes:
	- I realized that some of my coding habits are not matching convention (e.g. naming/commenting conventions, etc.) so I read this to brush up on my skills. I also wanted to learn more about testing in Golang because Testdeck is based off Golang's testing library.
	- Personal Rating: 6/10 (can skip) because it is good for beginners, but I wish it included more advanced information about Golang's testing library (it didn't really go into detail).

## Building Microservices (by Sam Newman)
- Status: DONE (Jan-Mar 2020)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/
- Notes:
	- Good introduction to microservice architecture and concepts, why companies are moving away from monolithic architecture, etc.
	- Personal Rating: 9/10 (extremely helpful!) because it makes microservices easy to understand even for beginners. If you read this with Kubernetes in Action (by Marko Luksa), I think you'd be all set to be a Microservices Engineer!
