- Status: Done (Jan 2021)

- Notes:
	- This is a really good book for beginners, it explains basic investment concepts in a way that's easy to understand
	- Covers most basics that any investor should know such as common sense, risk, portfolio allocation, distribution of assets, different types of investments, etc. 
	- Covers Japan-specific investments such as iDeco, NISA, etc.
	- Personal Rating: 10/10 (must read!) because it provides a ton of information and is very easy to understand even for people with no prior knowledge or experience with investing
