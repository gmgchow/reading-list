# Finance and Investment・金融と投資

## 投資信託超入門 (by 佐々木 裕平、 2021)
- Status: Done (Jan 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00HF35RL2
- Notes:
	- This is a really good book for beginners, it explains basic investment concepts in a way that's easy to understand
	- Covers most basics that any investor should know such as common sense, risk, portfolio allocation, distribution of assets, different types of investments, etc.
	- Covers Japan-specific investments such as iDeco, NISA, etc.
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because it provides a ton of information and is very easy to understand even for people with no prior knowledge or experience with investing

## 年収２００万円からの貯金生活宣言 (by 横山 光昭、 2009)
- Status: Done (Jan 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B009SKNUNM
- Notes:
	- This book doesn't offer any concrete tips on how to save money, but it teaches the mindset necessary (e.g. questioning the necessity of all purchases and expenses, separating spending into Needs/Wants/Investment, and the need to shift more spending into Investment in order to save for the future)
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because many people spend more than necessary on things that they don't actually need, and this book encourages the mindset of shifting that spending into investing for the future instead

# Psychology・心理学

## うまくいっている人の考え方 (by ジェリー・ミンチントン、 弓場隆、2013)
- Status: Done (Jan 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00CPLJK62
- Notes:
	- This book teaches 100 core values and cognitive patterns that successful people tend to have, such as "Don't try to change people", "Take responsibily for your own mistakes", "Be kind to yourself", etc.
	- The tips are separated into ten categories: 1) Be Tolerant of Yourself, 2) Self-Care, 3) Self-Acceptance, 4) Seeing Value in Yourself, 5) Live Your Own Life, 6) Changing Your Perspective of Things, 7) Connecting with Others, 8) Thinking Positively, 9) See Yourself as Who You Are, and 10) Lead Your Own Life
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because as I read through the 100 points, many of them hit me very hard and I think it's not uncommon to fall into these cognitive traps. This book explains each point very well and makes it easy to see why successful people don't do such things. The words in this book are also very positive so it was a refreshing read, I personally think everyone should read this so that they can become aware of making these mistakes.

## 話し方で損する人 得する人  (by 五百田 達成 、 2018)
- Status: Done (July 2022)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4799323466
- Notes:
	- This book teaches communication patterns and styles of people who are well-liked by those around them, vs people who are seen as difficult or not fun to talk to.
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because while a lot of these seem like common sense, many people are actually awkward and poorly-skilled in the art of conversation so I think everyone should read this as a common courtesy to people they talk with


## 人は話し方が９割 (by 永松 茂久、 2019)
- Status: Done (Jan 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4799108425
- Notes:
	- This book teaches how to make human relationships (at work, school, home, anywhere) go more smoothly by communicating in a more effective matter
	- Most of this book felt like common sense to me (e.g. listening is as important as speaking, people like talking about themselves, don't bring up topics that the person might not like, be positive, etc.) but common sense is not always common so this book was still interesting to read
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because a lot of people don't realize that the way we say something means way more than what we actually say. This book teaches how to be a pleasant person who communicates in a way that makes people want to listen and follow you
