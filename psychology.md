## The Social Animal
- Status: Done (June 2021)
- https://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Elliot-Aronson-ebook/dp/B07CSJ3W4Q
- Notes: 
	- It's a university-level psychology textbook so it's very long, but definitely worth reading!
	- It teaches principles of social psychology that you can use in persuading people, avoiding conflict, and making overall communication smoother
	- Personal Rating: **10/10 (must read!)** because personally, I believe that everyone should know at least some social psychology. It can be used in daily life as well as work, regardless of the industry because human connection matters more than you think.

## How to Win Friends and Influence People (by Dale Carnegie, 1998)
- Status: Done (Sept 2021)
- https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034 
- Notes: 
	- It provides tips on how to be a likeable person, leave a good impression, and influence others to help you
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because even though some of the points seem like common sense (e.g. to be a great conversationist, talk about topics that the person likes, listen more than you speak, etc.), many people don't actually have this sense. By following these tips, I do think that people will like you more as a person, therefore making it more likely that they will listen to and come to your aid.

## The Third Ear: You Can Learn Any Language (by Chris Lonsdale, 2006)
- Status: Done (Feb 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00823W5B4
- Notes:
	- It provides lots of tips on how to become fluent in languages you're studying (the author himself is fluent in 5 languages and is conversational level in several more)
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because it preaches that the most important part of learning a language is daring to use it. I also believe that you have to continuously practice a language in order to become fluent so I found the anecdotal stories to be inspiriational.

## Influence (by Robert Cialdini, 2009)
- Status: Done (April 2021)
- https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/influence/9780061899874/
- Notes:
	- I consider this as an introduction level book because it covers basics from first-year university psychology courses like Foot-in-door, Door-in-face, etc. Most points I already knew but if you don't have a background in psychology, it could be good to read.
	- Personal Rating: **7/10 (good to read)** because it did cover some good points to know but the wordy writing style made it difficult to read and stay focused. I think it could have been good if the writing was more concise and focused on teaching rather than going off into long detailed stories.
