## The Third Ear: You Can Learn Any Language (by Chris Lonsdale, 2006)
- Status: Done (Feb 2021)
- https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00823W5B4
- Notes:
	- It provides lots of tips on how to become fluent in languages you're studying (the author himself is fluent in 5 languages and is conversational level in several more)
	- Personal Rating: **8/10 (very good!)** because it preaches that the most important part of learning a language is daring to use it. I also believe that you have to continuously practice a language in order to become fluent so I found the anecdotal stories to be inspiriational.

- Notes:
	- I consider this as an introduction level book because it covers basics from first-year university psychology courses like Foot-in-door, Door-in-face, etc. Most points I already knew but if you don't have a background in psychology, it could be good to read.
	- Personal Rating: **7/10 (good to read)** because it did cover some good points to know but the wordy writing style made it difficult to read and stay focused. I think it could have been good if the writing was more concise and focused on teaching rather than going off into long detailed stories.
